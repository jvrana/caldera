# Caldera 🌋

![pre-commit](https://github.com/jvrana/caldera/workflows/pre-commit/badge.svg)

**SOFTWARE IS IN ALPHA, README IS PENDING**

**Caldera** is a Pytorch extension for learning on graphical data. It learns underlying causal relationships in data.

**Inspirations**

* Pytorch Geometric [ADD REF]
* GraphNets [ADD REF]
* Pyro Probabilistic Programming Language
* Pearl, J. (2009). Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference.
* Pearl, J. (2018). Theoretical impediments to machine learning with seven sparks from the causal revolution.

## Acknowledgements

* [rusty1s/pytorch_scatter](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter) - an awesome library that provides missing 
scatter methods in pytorch. Necessary for graph attribute aggregation
* PyTorch Geometric - 
* PGN - provided a blueprint for implementing this library
