**SOFTWARE IS IN ALPHA, README IS PENDING**

**Caldera** is a Pytorch library for creating recurrent neural networks that operates on sequence and graph data.


**Features**

* Graph data processing methods
* Adaptive computation time
* Graph aggregation attention


## Gallery

## Usage

### Installation

Due to constraints with installing pytorch and torch-scatter, it is not possible
to reliably install this package with pip.

The following packages must be installed manually: `pytorch`, `torch-scatter`

#### via Conda

#### via Docker

**Build CUDA enable image**

```
docker build . -f docker/cu101/Dockerfile
```

**Build slim cpu-only image**

```
docker build . -f docker/cpu/Dockerfile
```

## Acknowledgements

* [rusty1s/pytorch_scatter](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter) - an awesome library that provides missing 
scatter methods in pytorch. Necessary for graph attribute aggregation
* PyTorch Geometric - 
* PGN - provided a blueprint for implementing this library
